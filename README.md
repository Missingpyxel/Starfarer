# Starfarer

Starfarer is a game for sure.

## For modders!
Knowing that people would want to mod Starfarer by directly editing the source code, I knew from day 1 that I would have to include a mod-loading system if I were to keep people from developing a bunch of modded clients (Not that that's a bad thing at all, competing standards can just cause issues for people lol)
I've built a (so far simple) mod-loading system into Starfarer, and given how Godot works, you have a crap ton of of freedom with how you can use it. If there's any features you would like me to add to the mod loader, you can PR or raise an issue, and I'll do what I can. I'd love to support modders as much as I can as a Minecraft modder myself.

### About buying the game...
You may have already realized that you can totally just download the source here and build the game if you already have Godot installed and avoid buying the game entirely.
This is a feature, not a bug.
I know many people genuinely can't afford the game, and I don't want them to be barred from playing the game entirely, but I also don't want to just release the game for free because I put so much blood, sweat, and tears into this project.
